This plugin lets you place a LinkedIn Share button on your WordPress blog as a widget and/or using shortcode.

== Description ==

To use the widget just drag it to a sidebar and choose one of three button styles. You can also specify a url to share. If you leave the url empty, the active page will be shared.

Using shortcode:
The simplest version is [share/] which will add a button without counter using the permalink of the page or post.

To further customize the button you can use the following attributes:
* mode: none (default), top or right to set the counter style
* url: Any url you would like visitors to share instead of the current page or post permalink

Some examples of correct usage of this shortcode are:
[share/]
[share mode="right"/]
[share mode="top" url="http://www.wordpress.org"/]

== Installation ==

Upload the LinkedIn Share Social Widget plugin to your blog, activate it and drag the widget to your sidebar. See description on shortcode usage.
